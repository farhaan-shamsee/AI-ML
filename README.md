# AI ML

## Day 1

* supervised learning: 

### Use cases

• disease predction
    ○ based on diff sym of person…we predict if person is sufering from the disease
    ○ models will predict the probability if u r going to have the disease
    ○ based on previous blodd test etc.
• Fintech domain
    ○ credit card industry
    ○ types of transaciotn to detect fraud or not
    ○ looking at diff fetures of transaction to check if it is fraud
    ○ fraud detection
cyber security

### Mean and Median

1. Mean and median
1. summary statistics, descriptive statistics
1. percentiles, outlier
1. exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   1. looking at data sets and figuring out patterns
1. MEAN: average of salaries
1. MEDIAN: central value of data
1. sort data in ascending and look at middle value

1. Outlier: data point that is significantly different from others
   1. If there is outlier, it can skew the mean
   2. Median is more robust to outliers
   3. Never trust the mean/averages. For example, never trust the average salary of the company.
   4. ![mean-median](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b06c6208-d2a1-4103-b4c5-c8ecdb4b7870)

1. Histogram: bar chart that shows the distribution of data
   1. X-axis: range of values
   2. Y-axis: frequency of values
   3. ![histogram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb28768-66e9-48a9-b44e-97300f572cc2)
      1. this is a right skewed distribution
      2. happens when there are outliers on the right side
   4. ![histogram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a5d34d-872e-4dd5-bd16-83f0aa8c09e8)
      1. this is a left skewed distribution
      2. happens when there are outliers on the left side
      3. most of students have secured high marks and less number of students have secured low marks
   5. Why skew is important?
      1. it make the ML biased
   6. Uni variate analysis
      1. able to look at a distribution of a single variable
      2. histogram is a good way to visualize this
   7. Bi variate analysis
      1. able to look at a distribution of two variables
      2. For example: country wise per capita income
   8. transform skewness: transform the data to make it more normal distribution
